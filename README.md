# Playstation Vita Port of DevilutionX (Diablo)

<!-- ![](https://i.imgur.com/DKVB198.png) -->

<!-- ### How To Play:
- Extract contents of diablo-nx.zip release into SDMC:\switch\diablo-nx
- Copy DIABDAT.MPQ from original Diablo game disc or GOG version.
- Launch diablo-nx.nro
- *Note:* Hold R on any installed game and launch it. Do not use photo-album to launch. If you use photo-album, the homebrew only has very little memory available, and the touch keyboard doesn't work. This is true for all homebrew, not just Diablo-NX.
- Enjoy :) -->
